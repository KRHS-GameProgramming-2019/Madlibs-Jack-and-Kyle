One day nintendo character was walking down the street and they saw a color kart/bike and they stole it, they went to the city town auto shop and put a color first name letter on it.
After that, they went to the Go Kart track and saw different nintendo character there. He/she decided to drive onto the track with them and rode around the track for number hours.
He had so much fun that he decided to make a social media platform group and opened it to any other kart/bike riders to join, so he/she could ride with people all the time.
They became a pro Kart riders.
